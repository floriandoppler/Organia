### #1 - User-Interface 📱
Without any planning and sketches, not a single app could be on the market like it is today. Our goal is to create a timeless design, which is minimalistic and refined with beautiful pastel-colours. Everyone should be happy while keeping an eye on our app - we're working hard on that! 🙂

#### Timetable ⏰
To organise & structure a project in the best possible way, it is important to write down all the hours, where somebody sat down and put some work into it.
