### #1 - User-Interface 📱
Without any planning and sketches, not a single app could be on the market like it is today. Our goal is to create a timeless design, which is minimalistic and refined with beautiful pastel-colours. Everyone should be happy while keeping an eye on our app - we're working hard on that! 🙂
